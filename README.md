An attempt on doing tri-categories classification using simple LeNet on Coronahack-Chest-XRay-Classification based on Coronahack-Chest-XRay-Dataset  
Dataset could be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset

**Current result:**  
Loss on test set: 6.618380069732666  
Accuracy on test set: 0.6153846383094788  

Because of the computing resource limitation, LeNet is the only model used, would try ResNets if there is a chance.
